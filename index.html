      All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web. 
      <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language). HTML consists of elements that describe different
      types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web
      browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites. In HTML, each
      element is made up of 3 parts: 
      <ol>
      <li>The opening tag </li>
      <li>The closing tag </li>
      <li>The actual element Web Docs.</li>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">www.google.com</a>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Why should you learn HTML?</h2>
    <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
      <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix</li>
      <li>To build web applications</li>
      <li>To impress friends</li>
      <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
    </ul>
